# Face-Recognition
This project is a simple and fun real-time face recognition system built with Python and OpenCV.  It uses your webcam to spot faces, learn who a person is by taking their picture, and then instantly recognize them in a live video by drawing a box with their name around their face. It's a great example of computer vision in action!
